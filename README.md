# Project Mealy

## Getting started

Although there are two branches, main and [dev](https://github.com/Stutern-Project-23/Group-4-Mealy-Project-Team-A/tree/dev), we'll all be working with our own custom branches. So to get started:
- Clone the repository.
- Create and switch to your own branch with your name attached.
- Work in YOUR branch, not any of the two main ones mentioned above.
- Add and commit changes as usual.
- Push to YOUR branch, e.g
```
git add .
git commit -m 'Commit message'
git push --set-upstream origin YourBranch
```
- Make a pull request to the dev branch.
